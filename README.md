AI-Powered Clinical Triage Assistant is a data-driven decision-support tool designed to automate patient prioritization in Emergency Departments.

By leveraging a Random Forest Machine Learning model and a specialized clinical dataset, the system analyzes real-time vitals, symptoms, and medical history to provide instant Risk Stratification (Low/Medium/High).

The Problem it Solves: Traditional triage often relies on static rules that can miss high-risk cases. Our solution uses Comorbidity Weighting to detect critical conditions—like identifying a 72-year-old with a high heart rate as "High Risk"—ensuring life-saving care is delivered without delay.
Core Impact:
Reduces Clinical Cognitive Load: Automates department routing.

Prioritizes Safety: Optimized for High Recall to minimize missed emergencies.

Deployment Ready: Features a secure clinician login and a streamlined UI built with Streamlit.
